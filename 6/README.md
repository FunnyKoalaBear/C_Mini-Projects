Final project program of week 13
This program just adds vector and matrix multiplication functionality to project folder 5. 


6.2 Just for fun

If you consider the vector V to represent the (2-dimensional) point (3,4) then, based on the results of

the multiplications, can you guess what the matrices S and T might represent? If you can then test

your theory by modifying the vector and matrices to see if the results are what you expect.

Can you nowguess whatthe matrix product T ×S =TS represents when applied to a vector V? If

you have a theory about this then test it by modifying S and T and comparing the product TS×V to

your predicted result.
